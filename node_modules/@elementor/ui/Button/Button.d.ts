/**
 * Material UI has a known typescript problem with components that uses the 'component' prop:
 *
 * @see https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/32404#issuecomment-1105228783
 *
 * Therefore, adding a workaround by extending the source MenuProps interface and adding the 'component' prop.
 *
 * At the moment that the following PR is merged, this workaround can probably be removed:
 *
 * @see https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/35924
 *
 * Once the PR is merged, verify the fix by making sure that there is no typescript error in the following code:
 *
 * <Button component="a" href="https://www.elementor.com"></Button>
 *
 * The following components share the same problem: Button, IconButton, ToggleButton, List, ListItem, ListItemButton, MenuList, Menu, MenuItem, Paper, Dialog, Drawer, Typography.
